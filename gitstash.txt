Git Stash,


Git stash saves the uncommitted changes locally, allowing you to 
make changes, switch branches, and perform other Git operations. 
You can then reapply the stashed changes when you need them. 
A stash is locally scoped and is not pushed to the remote by git push.


Step to perform it

Save changes to branch A.
1. Run git stash.
2. Check out branch B.
3. Fix the bug in branch B.
4. Commit and (optionally) push to remote.
5. Check out branch A
6. Run git stash pop to get your stashed changes back.

Git stash stores the changes you made to the working directory locally 
(inside your project's .git directory; /.git/refs/stash, to be precise) and allows you to retrieve the changes when you need them. 
It's handy when you need to switch between contexts. It allows you to save changes that you might need at a later stage and is the 
fastest way to get your working directory clean while keeping changes intact.
