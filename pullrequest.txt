Pull Request

Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.
Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and 
add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.


Prerequisites need to be done

1. Save and commit any changes on your local branch. For more information, see "Committing and reviewing changes to your project."
2. Push your local commits to the remote repository. For more information, see "Pushing changes to GitHub."
3. Publish your current branch to GitHub. For more information, see "Managing branches."
